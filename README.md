Good job on HW1. I shall give you "88" in total, including "-3" for your untidy answers in Q1 and "-2" for wrong answer for (x+y-10z) please be careful! "-2" for miss using _ceil_ function for Q2; "-5" for your scant remarks in script which makes people hard to understand your logic flow. A good report need you to demonstrate what you thought and did, please pay more attention to writing more remarks/comments. keep going!

It would be better if you set the longitude = ‘180°E’ as the plotting center, which may make your result similar to the requested one (-2).
